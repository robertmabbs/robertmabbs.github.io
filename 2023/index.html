Year 2023 is coming to an end, and I have to face that I have not done many of my goals. I actually passed my driving test which I’m super happy about, but apart from that, nothing else has happen.<br />
<br />
I’m not the only one in this situation. At the start of the year millions of us these goals and lists. The thing is, without action this remains what it is words on digital devices or paper. Why do so many of us do this?<br />
<br />
My year <span class="bold">2023</span> started off well with the gym, but as you might guess. By February I stopped and I became static for rest of the year.<br />
<br />
I don’t know the statics, but I bet that my experince happens to most of us we start off great and slowly become static.<br />
<br />
We may blame ourselves for not trying hard enough or staying motivated. Which may be true, however when we pick dates to start something instead of just doing it, we create a delay. I found myself doing this with running. I said I will start on Sunday, but Sunday will come and the excuses will follow. So recently when I had that mindset with running I took action. On that day I got home from work put my running shoes started the couch to 5K podcast and off I went I done the hardest thing, Starting!.<br />
<br />
Do we set ourselves up to fail by simply setting up traditional dates in the future which we know the delay means we won’t do it or worse set future dates up again.<br />
<br />
So stop setting ourselves up to fail let’s get on and move forward in the moment, each time this happens a goal gets closer or an item is tick off from the list.<br />
<br />
2024 I won’t be setting dates to do my goals and items on my list. I’m going to get them done in the moment.<br />
